    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
            <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a bowl; transfer to a work surface floured with self-rising flour. Knead dough, adding more flour as needed to keep dough from being too sticky, for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spray a 12-inch pizza pan with cooking spray and spread dough to edges of pan.</li>
        </ol>
